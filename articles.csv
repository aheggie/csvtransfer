Sexualities and Accounting: a queer theory perspective,Nick Rumens,FALSE,"There is a paucity of research on sexuality within accounting studies in general, and next to nothing on lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans* (LGBT) sexualities in particular. One major problem associated with this neglect is that the heteronormative bias within the accounting studies goes unchallenged, reproducing a heterosexual/homosexual binary that posits heterosexuality as a normative standard by which other sexualities are judged and found wanting. Challenging the heteronormativity that pervades accounting studies and organisations, this article contributes to this knowledge void by presenting a new line of research which examines LGBT sexualities. It is argued that queer theory can enable accounting scholars to disrupt heteronormativity, destabilise essentialist notions sexuality as fixed properties of individuals and thus advance the study of sexuality within accounting beyond topics such as sexual harassment. Three research trajectories with example research questions are presented to that end: (1) disrupting heteronormativity; (2) queering accounting organisations; (3) queer allies in accounting contexts. In sum, this article underscores the utility of queer theory to accounting and sexuality research and practice, and calls for increased research activity of this type in this area",https://harringtonparkpress.com/download/oa-articles/Sexualities-and-Accounting.pdf,accounting
Optimistically Engaging in the Present: Experiences of Aging Among Gay Men,Beth L. Rodgers,TRUE,"This study explores the experiences of aging among gay men to further explain the phenomenon of gay male aging in contemporary terms, to put those experiences into a historically relevant context, and to expand upon previous findings on aging within the gay male population. Nineteen self-identifying gay men from a metropolitan area in South Florida were interviewed. The data collected were analyzed using grounded theory method. Findings from the study indicated that a great deal of optimism was revealed by the participants of the study in spite of their past adversarial experiences related to their sexuality and current challenges related to gay male sexuality and aging. Based on these findings, professionals working with an older population should consider the supportive environments that can most benefit this population in the community and even consider partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) oriented organizations to better serve the needs of their clients.",https://harringtonparkpress.com/download/oa-articles/Aging-Among-Gay-Men.pdf,social science
"Bisexualty, poverty and mental health: a mixed method analysis",Lori Ross,TRUE,"Bisexuality is consistently associated with poor mental health outcomes. In population-based data, this is partially explained by income differences between bisexual people and lesbian, gay, and/or heterosexual individuals. However, the interrelationships between bisexuality, poverty, and mental health are poorly understood. In this paper, we examine the relationships between these variables using a mixed methods study of 302 adult bisexuals from Ontario, Canada. Participants were recruited using respondent-driven sampling to complete an internet-based survey including measures of psychological distress and minority stress. A subset of participants completed a semi-structured qualitative interview to contextualize their mental health experiences. Using information regarding household income, number of individuals supported by the income and geographic location, participants were categorized as living below or above the Canadian Low Income Cut Off (LICO). Accounting for the networked nature of the sample, participants living below the LICO had significantly higher mean scores for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and reported significantly more perceived discrimination compared to individuals living above the LICO. Grounded theory analysis of the qualitative interviews suggested four pathways through which bisexuality and poverty may intersect to impact mental health: through early life experiences linked to bisexuality or poverty that impacted future financial stability; through effects of bisexual identity on employment and earning potential; through the impact of class and sexual orientation discrimination on access to communities of support; and through lack of access to mental health services that could provide culturally competent care. These mixed methods data help us understand the income disparities associated with bisexual identity in population-based data, and suggest points of intervention to address their impact on bisexual mental health.",https://harringtonparkpress.com/download/oa-articles/Bisexuality-Poverty-Mental-Health.pdf,social science
Across the Pond: Exploring the LGBT Heritage of England,Rob Ridinger,FALSE,"As 2017 will mark the fiftieth anniversary of the issuing of the Report of the Committee on Homosexual Offenses and Prostitution (more familiar to many LGBT people worldwide under the popular name The Wolfenden Report after its chair), it is appropriate to survey the literature produced on the history of the LGBT community of Great Britain in the decades since the text of the Report was received by Parliament in 1957.",https://harringtonparkpress.com/download/oa-articles/GLBTReviews.Off-the-Shelf-20.pdf,literature
The Folks Next Door: The Literatures of LGBT Canada,Rob Ridinger,FALSE,"For many Americans who do not live in the northern tier of states that share mountains, vast prairies, the Great Lakes and the border hills of New England with Canada, or who have no had occasion to travel there, the dynamic reality of our neighbor nation may be unfamiliar. Many of the research and reference works created on North American LGBT history and culture have a decidedly United States-centered orientation, while the extant literature on Canada’s LGBT communities from Prince Edward Island to British Columbia may not be well traveled on this side of the border. Understanding the varied literature covering the complexities of Canadian LGBT life and history requires certain background information.",https://harringtonparkpress.com/download/oa-articles/GLBTReviews.Off-the-Shelf-18.pdf,literature
